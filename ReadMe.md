# Keyboard Maestro Plugins: OmniFocus Task Meta Data

A port of my OmniFocus Keyboard Maestro Function Macros.

## Installation

1. Drag the zip files to Keyboard Maestro's Dock Icon.
2. Install the updated Macros for Date conversions and Task Note URLs by double clicking on `date_conv-note_urls.kmmacros`.


The New OmniFocus Actions should now appear in the Third Party Plug Ins smart group.

NB: I updated the Variables used by the plugins so that they wouldn't clash with your existing function macros. All variables generated by the plugins are formatted as:

	Plugin_OFTaskFoo
