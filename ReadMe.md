# Keyboard Maestro Plugins: OmniFocus Task Meta Data

A port of my OmniFocus Keyboard Maestro Function Macros.

## Update ##

As of 2013-06-07, the plugins have been removed from this repo. I am no longer a OmniFocus user. It would be irresponsible and careless of me to provide Keyboard Maestro plugins that I have no intention to support

If you are interested in maintaining the Keyboard Maestro plugins for future use, feel free to contact me.


## Installation

1. Drag the zip files to Keyboard Maestro's Dock Icon.
2. Install the updated Macros for Date conversions and Task Note URLs by double clicking on `date_conv-note_urls.kmmacros`.


The New OmniFocus Actions should now appear in the Third Party Plug Ins smart group.

NB: I updated the Variables used by the plugins so that they wouldn't clash with your existing function macros. All variables generated by the plugins are formatted as:

	Plugin_OFTaskFoo
